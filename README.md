# Signal Watermark on Large Language Models

This repository contains the code for the research paper "Signal Watermark on Large Language Models". The project demonstrates a novel method of embedding and detecting watermarks in texts generated by large language models, providing a unique approach to text authenticity and source verification.

## Overview

The project encompasses several Python scripts and modules designed to showcase the watermarking process. The code includes methods for generating watermarked text, analyzing text for watermark presence, and utilities for signal processing and text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Components

The repository is structured into multiple Python modules:

- `watermark.py`: Contains the main watermarking functions.
- `Watermark on LLMs OPT.py`: Demonstrates watermarking with OpenAI's OPT models.
- `watermark on LLMs.py`: General utilities for watermarking with LLMs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python packages.

## Installation

To set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arrrtour/signal-watermark-llm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd signal-watermark-llm
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each Python script can be run independently. For example, to execute the main watermark script:

```bash
python watermark.py
```

Please ensure you have the necessary API keys and configurations set up before running the scripts.

## Demos

The project includes a Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` that provides a step-by-step demonstration of the watermark embedding and extraction process. To run the notebook:

1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
   ```
